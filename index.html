    <h1>This Website Is To Show My Histogram</h1>

<h2>The histogram was made using the bookworm penguin <img src = "bookworm-penguin-300px.png"> <h2>
<p>The following histogram shows the distribution of the bookworm penguin's quiz grades over a forty day period.

  <p>The histogram was made using excel and the data provided by the moodle page. I entered the data into excel,
    went to the insert tab and pressed add histogram. I then had to add axes to the histogram, a title, and reorder
    the bins used to separate the data. With this and a color change, I got the graph shown above.</p>
  <p> PS. To those of you grading. Hope you have a fantastic day. Make sure to get ahead on stuff and enjoy the little things
    (: </p>
